# 3. Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

clean_approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(enddate=mdy(enddate),
         week=isoweek(enddate)) 
```


Based on this data we want to create
What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r}
clean_approval_polllist <- clean_approval_polllist %>%
  filter(subgroup == "Adults") %>%
  mutate(daily_approval_margin = approve - disapprove)
```

```{r}

weekly_avg_app_rates <- clean_approval_polllist %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarize( mean_weekly_approval_margin = mean(daily_approval_margin, na.rm = TRUE),
             number_polls = n(),
             std_weekly_approval_margin = STDEV(daily_approval_margin)) %>%

  mutate(lower_bound_CI_app_rate = mean_weekly_approval_margin - qt(0.975, df=number_polls-1)*std_weekly_approval_margin/sqrt(number_polls),
         upper_bound_CI_app_rate = mean_weekly_approval_margin + qt(0.975, df=number_polls-1)*std_weekly_approval_margin/sqrt(number_polls))
         
```

```{r}
ggplot(weekly_avg_app_rates, aes(x=week)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=mean_weekly_approval_margin, color="red")) +
  geom_line( aes(y=mean_weekly_approval_margin, color="red")) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_bound_CI_app_rate, 
                 ymax = upper_bound_CI_app_rate), 
                 show.legend = NA,
                 fill = "grey",
                 colour = "orange", 
                 alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y= mean_weekly_approval_margin), fill=NA)+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color="orange", size=3)+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Estimating Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove) for Joe Biden",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "Week of the year",
    y = "Average Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
